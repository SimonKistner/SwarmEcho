# SwarmEcho Command Reference

This document serves as a cheat sheet for all common execution commands in the SwarmEcho project, organized by the logical workflow of designing, testing, training, and analyzing.

Unless noted otherwise, run all commands from the project root directory.

---

## Environment Setup & Smoke Tests

### 1. Activate Virtual Environment
If you prefer to work inside the virtual environment rather than prefixing commands with `uv run`:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

---

## Map Design & Analysis Dashboard

### 2D Grid Maze Builder
Launch the browser-based editor to draw grid mazes and target no-spawn cells:
```bash
uv run swarmecho-maze-builder
```

### Discovery & Analysis Dashboard
Launch the Streamlit visualization tool to check run stats, compare parameters, and view evaluation/rendering videos:
```bash
uv run swarmecho-dashboard
```

### Consolidated Map Preview & Renderer
Render static images or short video/GIF rollouts (always simulated) of any map blueprint. All outputs are automatically saved to `outputs/map_previews/`:
```bash
# Render default static PNG blueprint image (showing spawn zones and real spawn positions)
uv run swarmecho-render M03_big_maze

# Render a simulated video rollout (MP4, 10 frames, 3 drones, 1 target, 1 base)
uv run swarmecho-render M03_big_maze --mode video

# Render a clean architectural SVG blueprint without spawns or zones
uv run swarmecho-render M03_big_maze --format svg --no-spawns --no-zones

# Render a snappy simulated GIF preview using a specific level config
uv run swarmecho-render M01_small_maze --mode gif --level M01_small_maze
```

---

## Drone Swarm Training

### Single Run Training
Train a drone swarm on a specific level:
```bash
uv run swarmecho-train level=M01_small_maze logging.run_name=maze01_v1 logging.wandb_mode=disabled
```

### Multi-Seed Sequential Training
Run multiple training iterations with the same configuration, utilizing different random seeds. The run name will automatically receive a `_seed_N` suffix:
```bash
uv run swarmecho-multi-train level=M01 logging.run_name=maze01_v2 seeds=5 base_seed=99
```

### General Grid Search
Sweep arbitrary configuration values for one level. Repeat `--grid` for each
parameter axis and use `--set` for overrides shared by every run:
```bash
uv run swarmecho-grid-search M01_small_maze \
  --grid training.lr=0.0001,0.0003 \
  --grid training.ent_coef=0.0,0.01 \
  --set evaluation.eval_video=false
```

### Curriculum Training
Train through sequential levels (inheriting checkpoint weights from the previous level) either with default stages or custom levels:
```bash
# Run the maintained default small-maze stage
uv run swarmecho-curriculum

# Run a custom sequence of levels
uv run swarmecho-curriculum levels=M00,M03,M02,M01
```

## Spatial Failure Analysis Pipeline

### Run Evaluation Sweep & Generate Heatmaps
Simulate the configured parallel evaluation batch, save comprehensive target/outcome/distance data, and generate heatmaps (failed chain targets, and found-and-delivered or split target-not-found heatmaps):
```bash
uv run swarmecho-evaluate-pipeline checkpoint=outputs/my_run/checkpoints/ckpt_001000 evaluation.save_eval_info_as_csv=true
```
